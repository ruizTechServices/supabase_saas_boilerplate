<h2>Boilerplate...</h2>


<h2>Supabase, TailwindCSS, NextJS, ShadCN, GPT-4 api, Stripe, & Pinecone boilerplate for busy devs...</h2>

<p>I, Luis, tend to frequently use this stack together often, so, I decided to curate this specific boilerplate to not continue constantly
remaking the wheel. </p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<h4>Of course, we all know we need our api keys from each of the respective apis. We would also need to install all the packages. But, of course, 
this is enabled with NPM, we can just run `npm i` in the terminal after cloning this repo. </h4>

<h2>After install</h2>
<h3>After install, make sure you fill in the information in the `.env.local` file. First, copy the `.env.local example` file and create a new one as a `.env.local` file.</h3>
